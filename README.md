Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app I developed was a weight tracking app that a user can log into and then record and track daily weights
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The App needed a login screen and a screen to display the data. All other screens were treated as temporary pop ups so the user would know they are not necessary. I think the data screen could have been better if it had some sort of visual representation with it.
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I tried to create a UI skeleton before coding anything. I liked this but I think too many changes to the UI are made after coding begins so I think not a ton of time should be put into the initial UI.
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
While I was coding I encludd log statements that would help me diagnose problems. This helped me get to the root of any problems I created or found.
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think I did a good job creating a clean UI with no distracting or unnecessary features.
